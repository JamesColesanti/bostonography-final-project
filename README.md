# Bostonography Course Project
This is a data visualization of the City of Boston's 2021 Reported Energy AND Water Metrics, found here: https://data.boston.gov/dataset/building-energy-reporting-and-disclosure-ordinance/resource/a7b155de-10ee-48fc-bd89-fc8e31134913

### Running the code locally

In the root directory, run `npm start` (you'll need to run `npm install` the very first time). After several moments (or minutes, depending on the speed of your machine), a browser will open with the code running locally.

### Public domain
To view the visualization without manually running the code, visit this domain hosted on Netlify: https://clinquant-pie-0e9586.netlify.app/
